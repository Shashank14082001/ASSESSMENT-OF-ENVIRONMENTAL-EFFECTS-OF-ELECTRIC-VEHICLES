# ASSESSMENT-OF-ENVIRONMENTAL-EFFECTS-OF-ELECTRIC-VEHICLES
The results show that the relevant parameters of e-mobility are the used power generation mix, the dimension and lifetime of the battery system as well as the driving profiles and total mileage of the EVs. Due to the use of rare and high-tech materials, the additional components of the EVs lead to an increased relevance of the production phase, whereas the battery system has the main contribution. During the use phase, the EVs cause lower environmental impacts compared to the CVs, which currently represents the environmental benefit of e-mobility. Using the German power mix, the GWP of current EVs are in a comparable range with gasoline vehicles. However, a significant reduction of the GWP is reached when the EVs are charged with additional installed renewable energies, e.g. wind power. Regarding the AP of the EVs, the study showed that the contributions of the EVs are considerably higher than the CVs, whereas also the main impact is due to the production and dimensioning of the battery system. The results of the future scenarios presented that considerable improvements in the EV life cycle can be reached in a long term view. However, the study also shows that there are still many open questions that have to be further addressed for a reliable assessment of e-mobility.
